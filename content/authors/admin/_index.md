My name is Alec and I am second year Computer Science PhD student at Northwestern University, working under Professor Alok Choudhary, Alexander Misharin, and Professor Ankit Agrawal.

My research involves integrating AI in the field of medical science. I am transforming patient care through AI-driven methodologies, focusing on predicting disease onset and tailoring response strategies for personalized treatment. My work is particularly significant in managing patients with Systemic Sclerosis-Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD) and critical decisions surrounding extubation in intensive care units.

My research also extends into materials science. I am developing advanced AI algorithms for materials discovery, with a special emphasis on identifying the most effective catalysts in chemical reactions. My approach is unique in its commitment to reducing computational complexity, accelerating the discovery process and preventing the need for prolonged experimental procedures.

During my free time, I enjoy golfing, tennis, cooking, and dancing.
